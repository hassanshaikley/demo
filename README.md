## Introduction

It's a CLI that asks you questions and then responds.

## Commands

- `npm start` - Starts the CLI
- `npm test`  - Runs the tests

## Comments

- It doesn't use babel because I don't want a build step for simplicities sake. Normally I would use the import/export syntax.
- If you have any feedback I would honestly love to hear it.
