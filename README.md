It's a CLI that asks you questions and then responds based off of your answers.

## :four: Comments

- :chart_with_upwards_trend: The first thing I ever programmed was a CLI like this in Visual Basic in middle school
- :hourglass: It doesn't use babel because I don't want a build step for simplicities sake
- :smile: If you have any feedback I would honestly love to hear it
